# QuickDS

QuickDS is a library that contains a curated list of **Input Formatting** and **Input Generating Functions** that can be
used to **generate some commonly used Abstract data types** without having to write any code from scratch. This library
was designed for the purposes of making competitive programming easy. Users can quickly convert **Serialized Input
formats into actual datastructures** to quickly test their code in local IDE
